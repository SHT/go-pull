# go-pull
Compiles and starts a go program, automatically pulls updates and restarts its process. I was bored, okay?

*Note:* Currently only working on Windows. If you want Unix support, you are free to implement it :D

## Setup

`go build`

## Usage

`go-pull <repo-path>`

You can provide a relative or absolute path to a git repository, and if there is a `main.go` file inside, it will automatically compile and launch it, and update and restart when new commits are pushed to the repository.

*Note:* There must be a remote called `origin` set up and by default go-pull tracks the `master` branch. Additionally, your working directory **must not** have any unstaged stages.
